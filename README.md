# 3DscanPi3
Using occipital's 3D Structure Sensor on a Raspberry Pi 3
This is the scanner:  https://structure.io/
Going to start with these instructions: http://www.ferienvillaflorida.de/labs//3d/sensors/2016/12/01/raspberry-pi.html
Will incorporate a Pi camera module V2.  Probably two of them, each attached to their own Pi Zero W.
Need to figure out how to stream all images to a PC on the same local network.
